## WordShell  
I love learning new English words. Sometimes from novels, sometimes from the movies and sometimes from the.. terminal?  
What if each time you open a terminal a _cow_ pops up with a new set of word along with its meaning? Pretty novel!

### Install Instructions
Simply execute the script **main.sh** from your terminal as a **root** user and voila the next time you pop up a terminal there it is.

### How it works?
I have already included a PDF named WL1.pdf. You can always add more PDFs from [wordbot](https://www.greedge.com/wordbot/home.html).
The code automatically _mines_ the words with their meaning and creates a file named _gre_ in your home folder. Then this file is invoked  through _cowsay_  each time you fire up a terminal.
